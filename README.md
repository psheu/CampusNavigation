# Navigating Loyola - Get Me There
Currently, there is no tool that would help a student navigate efficiently around campus or to find out the optimal route, which might entail shortcuts that only insiders (e.g., upperclassmen) know.
It is often difficult to find the most direct route to classes, particularly for freshmen and visitors, and especially with less popular buildings. The Get Me There software is intended to aid Loyola University Chicago students in enhance how they navigate the Lake Shore campus. Benefits would include, avoidance of undesirable weather conditions, decreased travel time, or more scenic routes. The objective is to allow the users to choose their priority from the three above, and to provide an ideal route to fit their needs.

The Get Me There project is a new product that will consist of a mobile application and, in the future, a web portal. The mobile application will need to use the GPS location application within the mobile phone to find the location of the user. The GPS will provide the application with locations of both the user and the selected destination. Once the user destination is acquired, the system will provide the user with three most efficient routes ranked according to the user’s entered priority criterion: SPEED (fastest) or WEATHER (indoor/covered routing maximized), or SCENIC (lake-side routing maximized).

Overall, our system hopes to improve convenience, efficiency and the “happiness factor” throughout the Loyola community by making it easier to get around on campus.
